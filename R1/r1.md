Write a recursive program (Python or C++ programming language) for next requirements. You can use and extend for implementation the C++/Python model available in /Lab/R1, this model already containing recursive implementations for creating, printing and destroying of a List.
It is mandatory to work with a structure/class List.
For a List will be used a linked representation. Do not use containers from STL or predefined operations on lists in Python (append, len, slicing, etc.).

6. a. Add an element at the end of a list.
